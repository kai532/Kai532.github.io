            <h1>Why I chose this study</h1>
            <article>
                The reason i chose hz is because I always have had a interest in the ICT field. that interest is still there and I want 
                to do something with that. So choosing to study HBO-ICT was I pretty easy Choice I did hesitate between this study and 
                studying rights but in the end I decided ICT suits me better.
